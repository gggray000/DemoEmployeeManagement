<h2>Employee Management System Demo</h2>
This is a toy CRUD project inspired by the project I did on a Udemy Spring Boot course. No practical use, just want to combine everything I've learned from the course, including Java Spring Boot, MVC, JPA(Hibernate), Spring Security, Thymeleaf with Bootsrap, AOP and so on.

<h2>TODO</h2>
1. change the design of login page<br>
2. change the design of register and confirmation page<br>
